     <A NAME="task"></A>
<H4> A Lexical Analyzer </H4>

<P> This stage consists of one component of your Klein compiler
    and three auxiliary programs.  </P>

<UL>
<LI> Your primary task is:
     <BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>
     Write a scanner for Klein.
     </STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P> A scanner is a function or object that takes as input a
    string or sequence of characters and produces as output a
    sequence of Klein tokens.  </P>

    <P> Implement your scanner as one or more deterministic
    finite-state machines.  Be sure that your analyzer detects and
    reports lexical errors, such as numbers out of range or format.
    </P>  </LI>
<BR/>
<LI> Once your scanner produces a sequences of tokens:
     <BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>
     Write a program that uses your scanner to produce a listing
     of all the tokens in a valid Klein program.
     </STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P> Display one token per line.  For tokens with semantic
    content, such as an identifier or a number, display the content,
    too.  For example:
<PRE>
    &lt;program&gt;
    &lt;identifier&gt; HelloWorld
    &lt;leftparen&gt;
    &lt;identifier&gt; print
    &lt;rightparen&gt;
    &lt;separator&gt;
    &lt;integer&gt;    42
</PRE>  </P>  </LI>
<BR/>
<LI> In order to test your scanner,
     <BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>
     Produce at least one meaningful program written in Klein.
     </STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
     Your test program should be at the level of an early CS1
     program.

     <P> You should, of course, produce as many tests as necessary
     in order to ensure that your scanner works correctly.  You
     are also encouraged to use any test programs available on the
     project home page.  </P>  </LI>
<BR/>
<LI> Finally,
     <BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>
     Create a Unix command-line script named
     <FONT SIZE="+1"><TT>kleins</TT></FONT>
     that takes the name of a Klein program as an argument and
     runs your token-listing program on it.
     </STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <P> This will be the first in a series of tools that makes up
     the command-line suite of your Klein compiler.  </P>  </LI>

<H4> Submission </H4>

<P> By 5:00 PM on Friday, September 25, submit
    <A HREF="#deliverables">your deliverables</A>
    as follows:
    <UL>
    <LI> <EM>(electronically)</EM> &nbsp; a zipped file named
         <TT>project01.zip</TT> or <TT>project01.tar.gz</TT>
         containing all of your code files for the assignment
    <LI> <EM>(hardcopy)</EM> &nbsp; a print-out of the README
         file from your code submission folder
    </UL>  </P>

<P> Make your electronic submission using
    <A HREF="https://www.cs.uni.edu/~schafer/submit/which_course.cgi">
       the on-line submission system</A>.  </P>
<BR/>
<HR/>

     <A NAME="deliverables"></A>
<H4> Deliverables </H4>

<P> Submit only one copy of each assignment per team, both
    electronically and on paper.  </P>

<P> Submit a directory containing <B>all</B> of the source code for
    your scanner and any Klein programs that you use for testing.
    You may include other files, such as data files that document
    your regular expressions and FSAs or the output of sample runs
    of your programs.  Organize your project directory in a way
    that works for your team but also that makes the directory
    easy for readers to navigate.  </P>

<P> You must also submit a README file that explains the design
    of your solution, including any classes or modules and their
    interfaces, and any design decisions that you think will help
    the reader understand your program better.  </P>

<P> The README file and sample programs are important!  They define
    the scope of your work and will play an important role in how I
    approach your code.  </P>
<BR/>
<HR/>

<H4> Miscellaneous Notes </H4>

<UL>
<LI> The code for your compiler must be written only by you and your
     partners.  However, I encourage you to discuss the assignment
     with others in the course, and with me.  Learning how to think
     about big programming problems is an important part of this
     course, and we learn best what we describe, interpret, and do.  </LI>
<BR/>
<LI> Please adopt the programming standards of whichever language
     you are using.  If you are writing your program in Java,
     please use reasonable object-oriented style where appropriate.
     If you are writing your program in Python, please use standard
     Python programming style.  If you are writing your program in
     Racket, please use good functional programming style.  </LI>
</UL>
