resisters
=========
r0 = 0
r1 = const register
r2 
r3
r4
r5 - used for address manipulation
r6 = stackpointer (last address that caller can initialize + 1), and beginning of temp memory
r7 = program counter

stack frame
===========
                 returned value
                 arg0
                 arg1
                 ....
                 return address                       <- address to return too in memory
                 register state 0,1,....6             <- values of registers r0...r6, which includes stack pointer in r6
stackpointer --> t0
                 t1                                   <- so sp+n is the address of tn
                 t2
                 ....
