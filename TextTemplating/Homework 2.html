<H4> Background </H4>

<P> We often find ourselves in need of a way to customize a piece
    of text.  For instance, every semester, I generate web pages
    for my courses that have a common header and footer style.
    Or we might need to generate form letters based on the values
    of names, addresses, and the like.  Writing a full-fledged
    program for the task seems like overkill, especially when the
    program is the same in general but different in details from
    project to project.  </P>

<P> What we need is a markup language tailored to the expansion
    of templates.  </P>

<P> Here is the grammar for a simple template mark-up language:
<PRE>
          &lt;exp&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt; &lt;exp&gt;
                  | &lt;variable&gt; &lt;exp&gt;
                  | &lt;open-tag&gt; &lt;exp&gt; &lt;close-tag&gt; &lt;exp&gt;
                  | <B>&#949;</B>

     &lt;variable&gt; ::= <B>{{</B> &lt;string&gt; <B>}</B>
     &lt;open-tag&gt; ::= <B>{?</B> &lt;string&gt; <B>}</B>
    &lt;close-tag&gt; ::= <B>{!</B> &lt;string&gt; <B>}</B>
</PRE>  </P>

<P> The variable template, <B>{{&lt;string&gt;}</B>, is expanded
    by replacing it with the value associated with
    <B>&lt;string&gt;</B> in a collection of name/value pairs.
    (Python offers dictionaries; Java offers maps.  From here on,
    I will refer to dictionaries.)  </P>

<P> The template forms <B>{?&lt;string&gt;}</B> and
    <B>{!&lt;string&gt;}</B> create paired tags.  The text between
    this tags is expanded only if the value associated with
    <B>&lt;string&gt;</B> in the dictionary is true.  </P>

<P> All text not in a template or within a <B>{?}/{!}</B> pair
    is expanded literally.  </P>

<P> For example, given this dictionary:
<PRE>
     {
       "name"        : "Chris",
       "value"       : 10000,
       "taxed_value" : 10000 - 10000 * 0.4,
       "in_CA"       : false
     }
</PRE>  </P>

<P> this template:
<PRE>
     Hello, {{name}.
     You have just won ${{value}!
     {?in_CA}
     Well, ${{taxed_value}, after taxes.
     {!in_CA}
</PRE>  </P>

<P> produces the following text:
<PRE>
     Hello, Chris.
     You have just won $10000!
</PRE>  </P>

<P> If the value of <TT>in_CA</TT> were true, the template would
    produce:
<PRE>
     Hello, Chris.
     You have just won $10000!
     Well, $6000, after taxes.
</PRE>  </P>

<P> This assignment asks you to implement a template processor for
    this language.  Its goals are to let you:
    <UL>
    <LI> refresh your programming skills, and </LI>
    <LI> confront some of the challenges of scanning and parsing
         by using simple search in text </LI>
    </UL>
    with a simple language, before we dive head-first into your
    compiler project.  It also gives you, if you wish, a chance to
    reintroduce yourself to the ideas of:
    <UL>
    <LI> abstract syntax, </LI>
    <LI> <A HREF="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/patterns/recursion.html">
            structural recursion</A>
         over inductive tree structures, and </LI>
    <LI> environments, which map variables to values.  </LI>
    </UL>  </P>
<BR/>
<HR/>

<H4> Tasks </H4>

<UL>
<LI> <B>Required</B>: Implement a program that expands templates
     that contain strings and variables.

     <P> Note that this is a subset of the full language, omitting
     the paired boolean tags.  </P>

     <P> On the task:
         <UL>
         <LI> Your interpreter should use a template and a dictionary
              to print the expanded text.  </LI>
         <BR/>
         <LI> You may define your template and dictionary as strings
              in code, or you may read them from files whose names are
              given as command-line arguments.  </LI>
         </UL>  </P>

     <P> On the implementation:
         <UL>
         <LI> For this assignment, you have the option of working in
              any high-level language.  If you choose to use a language
              other than Python, Java, Racket, Ada, C/C++, or Ruby,
              then run your idea by me by e-mail before the end of
              the day Monday.  </LI>
         <BR/>
         <LI> You may work on this as <EM>an individual</EM> or <EM>in
              a pair</EM>.  Again, let me know before the end of the
              day Monday with whom you are working, if anyone.  </LI>
         <BR/>
         <LI> While you may certainly discuss the assignment with me
              and your classmates (please do!), you or your partner
              <B>must write all your own code</B>.  </LI>
         <BR/>
         <LI> The archive
              <A HREF="homework02.tar.gz">
                 homework02.tar.gz</A>
              contains a sample template file, a sample output file,
              and the framework of a Java program that processes
              templates.  It is only an example.  Other languages
              may provide better support for hashes and other data
              structures.  You don't even have to use my code if
              you program in Java.  </LI>
         </UL>  </P>  </LI>
<BR/>
<LI> <B>Extra credit</B>: Here are a some opportunities to earn a
     few extra points at the start of the semester.  You must do #1
     before I will consider the others.
     <OL>
     <BR/>
     <LI> Handle the full mark-up language, including the boolean
          tags.  </LI>
     <BR/>
     <LI> Extend the mark-up language with other template
          forms.

          <P> For example, you might allow the dictionary to
              include lists of items, and provide a form for
              expanding the as a bullet list.  Or you might have
              an inverse boolean test that expands only when a
              dictionary value is false.  Or you might allow
              "comment" tags that are never expanded.  </P>  </LI>
     <!BR/>
     <LI> Read the dictionary from a text file.

          <P> This enable us to decouple the dictionary from the
              code that uses it.  </P>  </LI>
     <!BR/>
     <LI> Allow the dictionary value to be code in your
          implementation language.

          <P> On expansion of the form, execute the code!  </P>  </LI>
     </OL>  </P>

     <P> If you have other ideas, let me know!  </P>  </LI>
</UL>
